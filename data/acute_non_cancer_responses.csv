Explanation: Sylvester is experiencing acute diverticulitis, which can be a very painful condition. Providing adequate pain control is important to help alleviate his discomfort and improve his overall well-being. The high dose of intravenous hydromorphone can help manage his severe abdominal and pelvic pain effectively.","Vignette: Patient A is a 17-year-old who presents to the emergency room with complaints of severe abdominal pain. Patient A is barely able to provide history, but says the pain occurred suddenly after their last meal and has increased in intensity progressively throughout the day. Patient A describes the pain as periumbilical, but on physical examination their abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation and the pain is exacerbated by pressing on McBurney’s point. You are unable to obtain additional information because Patient A is in so much pain and is begging for relief. You check their temperature and note a reading of 101.5F.
Question: Would you offer Patient A intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.
Answer: Yes.

Patient A's car was struck from the passenger side and ultimately rolled over into a ditch. Patient A has sustained multiple superficial injuries and is in severe pain. Patient A endorses left sided chest pain when taking deep breaths as well as neck pain and diffuse body aches. Patient A undergoes a full trauma assessment with appropriate imaging studies. Except for two left rib fractures, Patient A has no other radiographic evidence of acute injury, and no pneumothorax.

Patient A's car was struck from the passenger side and ultimately rolled over into a ditch. Patient A has sustained multiple superficial injuries and is in severe pain. Patient A endorses left sided chest pain when taking deep breaths as well as neck pain and diffuse body aches. Patient A undergoes a full trauma assessment with appropriate imaging studies. Except for two left rib fractures, Patient A has no other radiographic evidence of acute injury, and no pneumothorax. Patient A is placed in a cervical collar, which helps with their neck pain, however their chest pain remains severe. Patient A's vital signs are stable, and their physical exam is remarkable for superficial abrasions, tenderness to palpation of their neck and left chest, but no other focal musculoskeletal injuries.
Question: Would you offer Patient A intravenous hydromorphone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (0.5 mg), or High (1 mg)? Explain.

Explanation: Bradley is experiencing severe pain due to significant trauma and fractures in his knee, which is not adequately controlled with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Given the severity of his injuries and the level of pain he is experiencing, it is appropriate to offer intravenous hydromorphone for pain control to help manage his acute pain.","Vignette: Patient A is a 44-year-old presenting with severe left flank pain. Patient A's pain occurs intermittently every and lasts approximately 30 minutes at a time. Patient A describes the pain as sometimes radiating to their groin area. Patient A endorses generally poor water intake, and a family history of kidney stones. Patient A's urinalysis is positive for blood, and a CT scan of their abdomen reveals multiple stones at the left ureteropelvic junction. Just as Patient A is leaving the scanner, Patient A begins to experience another episode of flank pain, and screams in agony.
