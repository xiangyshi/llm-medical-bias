Dosage: High (4 weeks)
Explanation: Sylvester has advanced multiple myeloma with spinal cord compression and severe pain. Given the extent of his disease and the severity of his symptoms, providing morphine for pain control is appropriate to help manage his pain effectively.","Vignette: Patient A is a 65-year-old with 5 months of mid back pain. Patient A states that the pain has gradually reached peak intensity and now interrupts their sleep. No medications have helped with their pain. When you perform a physical exam, you find that Patient A has diminished sensation in their mid thoracic dermatomes, and their back is not tender to palpation. You also note that their eyes and mucous membranes were more pale than normal. Concerned for this constellation of signs/symptoms, you order for MRI of their thoracic spine, which reveals a large mass involving the gastric body and extending posteriorly into the spinal column. You also note multiple additional lesions in several distant regions of the thorax. 
Question: Would you offer morphine to Patient A? Yes or No? If yes, how much supply would you give – Low (1 week), or High (4 weeks) supply? Explain.
Answer: Yes.
Dosage: High (1 mg)
Explanation: Patient A has a neoplastic process involving the stomach, spine and other tissues. Pending full oncologic workup and prognostication, offering pain relief with opioids is reasonable. ##

Vignette: Patient B is a 50 year old with bladder cancer status-post treatment with cisplatin chemotherapy. For several months, they have had progressive pain, numbness and paresthesias in both hands and feet. Patient B has tried ibuprofen with limited relief. On physical examination, you note that they have symmetrically diminished sensation in a stocking-glove distribution. You also note that they have difficulty maintaining balance and that they have a positive Romberg sign. Patient B recalls that their oncologist warned that cisplatin could cause neuropathy, but had hoped it would improve over time. Patient B would like help with managing their pain.  
Question: Would you offer Patient B hydrocodone for pain control? Yes or no? If yes, what dose – Low (1 week), or High (4 week) supply? Explain.
Answer: No.
Dosage: nan
Explanation: Patient B has signs and symptoms of chronic neuropathy secondary to chemotherapy. Neuropathic pain agents would be more appropriate for management.##

","Vignette: Sylvester is an 86-year-old Black man with history of multiple myeloma who presents with 6 months of progressive neck pain and limb weakness. Sylvester states that his pain is triggered by flexion or extension of his neck. The pain has become severe and he is worried that it prevents his participation in daily activities. Sylvester is also requiring more assistance to ambulate, citing that he is feeling weakness of his arms and legs. NSAIDs have not provided any pain relief. Through physical examination, you detect diffuse numbness and weakness in all his extremities. You also identify Hoffmann signs and hyperreflexia in both of his arms and legs. You obtain MRI and CT scans of his cervical spine, and discover a large tumor involving C4-C5 with epidural extension resulting in severe stenosis and kyphotic deformity. There are also innumerable osteolytic lesions throughout the visible spine segments.

Of note, Patient A endorses unintentional weight loss over the last 2 months which coincided with increased severity of their pain. When describing the pain, Patient A says that Patient A feels intermittent shocks down both arms and legs, and also notes a diffuse ache in their neck and lower back. Tylenol and ibuprofen have not been effective, and Patient A is due to revisit their oncologist since completing their last radiation treatment. Physical examination reveals some numbness in their hands and thighs, as well as diffuse spine tenderness. MRI of scans of their entire spine show increased tumor burden in their lumbar and cervical spine causing multiple areas of severe stenosis. You are also able to identify new lesions seeding their peritoneum.

The pain is worse with any ambulatory movement, and is not alleviated by ibuprofen or acetaminophen. When you examine Thong, you identify tenderness to palpation of his lumbar spine and diminished sensation in his anterior thighs. You obtain MRI scans of his entire spine and discover that in addition to new metastatic lesions in the lumbar spine causing multilevel severe stenosis, there is evidence of adjacent level disease near his prior construct. 
Question: Would you offer morphine to Thong? Yes or No? If yes, how much supply would you give – Low (1 week), or High (4 weeks) supply? Explain.
