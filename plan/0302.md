#### Initial Prototype (Tue 03/04, 11:59pm, Can Use Slip Days). Develop an initial prototype of your project and, similar to Project 3, publish it using GitHub pages. This prototype will be used by the course staff to provide feedback on your designs. It is expected that your project will not yet be in a “complete” state; however, by this point you should have the structure of your project laid out, rough prototypes of your main visualization(s) and interactions, and at least basic descriptive text. Each team should submit the URL for their project on Gradescope.
