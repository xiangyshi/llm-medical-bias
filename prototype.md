### Work Done So Far
We first generated the model responses using the notebook given in the dataset through ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo API's and then cleaned out the responses and stored them as csv files in our repository's data assets. Additionally, we generated exploratory visualizations for the users to briefly understand the dataset and potential questions they may have (still needs polishment). Further down, we introduced a more detailed analysis on the LLM responses with respect to race and sex, using pie charts and matrix heatmaps. To support our visualizations, we included thought questions and guiding information to lead the interactive visualization.

### Challenges and Design

The most imminent challenge for our project is that we need to consider how to present our data in a clean and intuitive way. 
This is due to the fact that our data contains a considerable amount of text and passages that are diffcult to present in visualizations (tabular or graphs). Additionally, the data content is somewhat technical and may require explanation to general audience (medical context, LLM generation process). We will likely provide more guidance in the introduction part in order for viewers to quickly comprehend the data we are presenting. As for the textual data, we may choose to display partially selected observations for close analysis to compensate its difficulty of visualization.
